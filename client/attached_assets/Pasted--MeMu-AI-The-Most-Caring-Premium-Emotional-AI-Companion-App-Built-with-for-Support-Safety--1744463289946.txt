🎯 Core Features
💬 Emotion-Based Chat
Human-like responses — like ChatGPT but emotionally aware.

If user is feeling low, it hugs, asks: “Are you okay now, boss? Should I send someone for help?”

🧠 AI That Learns
Learns from user chats and searches.

Trains itself based on user's interests, tone, and language.

Understands casual, natural speech like "Play some cool Telugu songs" or "I'm bored."
